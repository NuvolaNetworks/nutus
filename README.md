### Nutus - The Nuvola tus.io Resumable File Uploader

Here be a Rails engine that is a minimal implementation of the [tus.io Open Protocol for Resumable Uploads](http://tus.io).

We're still not exactly sure what words are behind the TUS acronym, but we DO know that the protocol works.

This implementation is brought to you by the good folks at [Nuvola Networks](http://nuvola-networks.com), who currently use tus.io in production.

#### Coming soon! (April 2016-ish)

- Documentation!
- Open source license!
- Publish to rubygems.org!
- Fame! Fortune! (Or maybe at least a "Kudos guys, that thing you did was alright." :))
